# some progress on hot resource replacement `preview`

- Do `window._ojs.ojsConnector.mainModule.redefine("ans", 15)` to overwrite `ans`.

`umd2` is not defined: it's a placeholder:

 - Do `await window._ojs.runtime.interpret("umd2 = require('./resources/umd.js?v=4')\n\numd.ans\n\n", "ojs-cell-1-1", false)` after editing `resources/umd.js`, this sets the updated value without losing state (note: this isn't configured as a resource, or else it would trigger a full refresh. Really I want to replace that refresh mechanism - TODO (*I really want to conditionally replace.. but this means server work also & isn't necessary for my strict needs)*)
